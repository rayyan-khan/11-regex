# regex homework 1, due 2/13 10:30 am rayyan khan

# determine a regular expression which will match only on the indicated strings,
# or else will find the indicated matches.  The form for the submission will be
# a command line script that takes a single integer as input from 31 to 40,
# inclusive, and outputs the corresponding regular expression pattern, as it was
# done in class:  the pattern is to be delimited by forward slashes and any options
# should immediately follow the final slash.

               # 33. An integer (sub)string refers to a non-empty (sub)string
               # that will convert to an integer but has no leading 0.  Zero
               # is represented as the single digit 0.  Given a binary integer
               # string, what regular expression determines whether it is even?

               # where the dash indicates an arbitrary number of spaces with
               # at most one dash).  For example, 542786363,   542  786363,
               # and 542 – 78-6263 are all considered valid.
