# regex homework 4, due 3/1 10:30 am rayyan khan

# Determine a regular expression which will match only
# on the indicated strings, or else will find the indicated
# matches. The form for the submission will be a command
# line script that takes a single integer as input from 71
# to 80, inclusive, and outputs the corresponding regular
# expression pattern, just as with the prior HW. The pattern
# is to be delimited by forward slashes and any options
# should immediately follow the final slash.
