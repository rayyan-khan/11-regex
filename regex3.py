# regex homework 3, due 2/22 10:30 am rayyan khan

# Determine a regular expression which will match only
# on the indicated strings, or else will find the indicated
# matches. The form for the submission will be a command
# line script that takes a single integer as input from 41
# to 50, inclusive, and outputs the corresponding regular
# expression pattern, just as with the prior HW. The pattern
# is to be delimited by forward slashes and any options
# should immediately follow the final slash.

# For problems 51-53 no look ahead or look behind is allowed.
# For the remaining problems, you may use the full power of
# Python's regular expressions. For all the problems mentioning
# words (rather than strings), substrings and other comparisons
# are meant to be case insensitive unless otherwise specified.
# With strings, the default is case sensitive.
