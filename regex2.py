# regex homework 2, due 2/15 10:30 am rayyan khan

# Determine a regular expression which will match only
# on the indicated strings, or else will find the indicated
# matches. The form for the submission will be a command
# line script that takes a single integer as input from 41
# to 50, inclusive, and outputs the corresponding regular
# expression pattern, just as with the prior HW. The pattern
# is to be delimited by forward slashes and any options
# should immediately follow the final slash.

inp = int(sys.argv[1]) - 41 if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 0

# For problems 41-43, an Othello board will be construed to
# be and 8 × 8 board, represented as a single string, where
# holes (blanks) are indicated by a period (.), and the black
# tokens are indicated by either an x or X, and the white
# tokens are indicated by an o or O. The boards have no “buffer
# edge”. For the purposes of this problem, we are not concerned
# about whether we could actually reach a board in real play.
# For example, a board with tokens only at the corners would be
# considered a valid Othello board, and so would a completely
# empty board.
